# calculator
Python program that helped me to create code for calculator operations.All arthimetic operations are possible from,
--> Addition
--> Subtraction
--> Multiplication
--> Division
--> Modulus.....

Switch condition is *NOT POSSIBLE* in case of Python programming so here, I have used *ELSEIF* condition to run between different 
condtions (Arithmetic Operations)..By this way accessing different conditions are made possible.
